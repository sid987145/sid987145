👋 Yo! I’m @0riginal_Sid — part human, part stack trace.  
🚀 Future astronaut, current software explorer navigating the MERN galaxy.  
🧠 I break stuff just to fix it better. Code is my chaos & canvas.  
🌱 Learning how to build full-stack apps (and survive Mondays).  
💻 Projects: ticket booking sites, smart galleries, personal portfolios — all launched, no crashes (yet).  
🤝 Always up for collabs with solo coders, curious minds, and space dreamers.  
🕵️‍♂️ Usually found between Git commits and caffeine highs.  
📫 Reach out at sid987145@gmail.com or star my repo — I notice both.
🌌 Fun Fact: I debug bugs on Earth, but aim to deploy on Mars.
